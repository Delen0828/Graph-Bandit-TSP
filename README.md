# Graph-Bandit-TSP
This repo is for the experiment of replacing the use of MCTS in TSP problem.
Currently, only one learning case has been implemented using UCB algorithm. The next step is to repeat it on 10000 cases of tsp20, and also larger TSP problems.
To run the code, simply run "python test.py". A shell file will be added in the future if passing args is necessary.
Correct Answer can be download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lmQh1SYFlcaEcvWdKZBs30GyYL-m21nb/view, each line correspond to each file. Please calculate the accucy rate by comparing the bandit result with the answers!
